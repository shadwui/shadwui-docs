# ShadwUI

**Beautiful UI components built with Tailwind CSS and React.**

## Getting Started

shadw UI is designed to integrate seamlessly with Next.js, react and vite projects, but the components are also compatible with any React-based project. The components follow shadcn conventions, so they'll feel familiar to anyone who has used shadcn before.

**1. Set up the required files:**
 
- **Installation** [https://shadwui.com/docs/installation](https://shadwui.com/docs/installation)

After completing these steps, you can copy and use the components in your project. Note that some components (e.g., number inputs, date pickers, time pickers, phone number inputs) may require additional libraries.

## Tailwind v4 support

Our UI library has been updated to Tailwind CSS v4 as of February 25, 2025. Legacy components built with v3 remain available by adding `/legacy/` to the component URL:

```bash
# v3 component
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://shadwui.com/r/input.json
```

Note: New components will only be developed for Tailwind v4.
